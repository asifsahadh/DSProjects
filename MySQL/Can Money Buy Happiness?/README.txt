This assignment investigates the relationship between economic prosperity and overall well-being to explore the question, "Can money buy happiness?" Using a dataset that includes indicators like Log GDP Per Capita, Healthy Life Expectancy at Birth, and other information analysis is performed on how these factors correlate across different countries. By leveraging SQL queries, the goal is to identify patterns that may suggest whether higher economic development leads to better health outcomes and a higher quality of life. This exploration aims to provide insights into how economic factors influence happiness and well-being, and whether money plays a significant role in enhancing the lives of individuals in various regions.

CONCLUSION - Based on the given analysis, it appears that money (represented by GDP Per Capita) does not directly guarantee happiness (represented as Life Ladder), as there are only limited overlaps between high GDP and high life satisfaction or healthy life expectancy. This could indicate that there are other factors that play a significant role in determining happiness. These can be better health care systems, more freedom of choices and expression, better social support, very low corruption, etc.
